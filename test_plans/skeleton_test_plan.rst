Basic Forwarding Sample Application
===================================

The Basic Forwarding sample application is a simple *skeleton* example of a
forwarding application.

It is intended as a demonstration of the basic components of a DPDK forwarding
application. For more detailed implementations see the L2 and L3 forwarding
sample applications.

Running the Application
-----------------------

To run the example in a ``linuxapp`` environment:
    ./build/basicfwd -c 2 -n 4

Refer to *DPDK Getting Started Guide* for general information on running
applications and the Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) options.

test_skeleton
===================

Runing::
     ./examples/skeleton/build/basicfwd -c 2 -n 4

waked up :
     Core X forwarding packets.

Send one packet on Port0,check the port1 receive packet.
It receive one packet that the port0 send.
